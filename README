INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install

BASIC USE

This experimental module lets you capture test suite results over time.  Basic
usage is:

  bin/hprove t/

In other words, use it just like the regular C<prove> command.

C<hprove> is not installed.  You have to do this manually as this is all very
experimental.

To see the test results:

  sqlite3 .provedb

If you prefer another database name, use the C<--db> switch.

  bin/hprove --db=my_project.db t/
